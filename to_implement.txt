(these are notes for my own benefit)

runlength encoding vs. piano roll encoding vs. note-tuple encoding

training using masks (diagonally) vs. training on introduced errors

error detection via masking and reconstructing ('how unlikely is this note?') vs explicit error
detection (see MDTK, 2020)

need:

generalizable way of comparing results between different methods.
